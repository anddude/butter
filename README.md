###🧈 Butter — Progressive AI Text Summarization

Butter is a full-stack AI/ML project that explores how increasingly intelligent systems improve text understanding—starting from a deterministic, no-AI baseline and evolving into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

The project demonstrates why AI is useful, not just that it is, by incrementally layering complexity and capability.
